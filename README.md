# Task List Application

Task List Application is a fantastic Application that changes the background image when a page refreshes and greets you with a message based on the time of day. You can make your own Todo list and set your daily main task using Application.


## List of features
### Home Page
You can begin by adding your name to the home page and then navigate to the task page by pressing the enter key. The home page will display a new, calming background image if you refresh it.
### Task Page
You can add your primary or focus task for the day to the task page. When you finish it, you can either check it or clear it to start a new task. At the bottom right of the website, there's a lovely ToDo that allows you to add tasks. The primary task will be removed when the date changes, but the Todo list will remain.
